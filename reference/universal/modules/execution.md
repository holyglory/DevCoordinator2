## 5. Coordinate tools, delegated work, and asynchronous execution

### UI implementation admission

- Before any implementation batch that introduces or materially recomposes a
  shipped product UI element, verify that the admission portion of
  `ui-design-gate` has completed.
- While admission is pending, discovery and preparation of the three design
  artifacts may continue, but product edits, scaffolding, preview startup,
  implementation tests, and delivery work are paused for that UI scope.
- A displayed user selection or an explicitly recorded autonomous-selection
  authorization is the admission evidence. A proposed option, generated image,
  implementation plan, or agent preference is not selection evidence.
- If the design skill, Image Gen capability, or Coordinator evidence path is
  unavailable, preserve the pending gate and report the blocker; do not bypass
  it with a code-first implementation.

### UI handoff audit

- For UI backed by a confirmed mockup or approved visual target, verify that
  the post-implementation mockup audit in `ui-design-gate` has passed before
  reporting completion or handing the surface off.
- A missing or blocked `$product-design:audit`, unavailable comparison
  evidence, or any unresolved P0-P2 finding keeps the UI incomplete. Fix the
  affected surface and repeat the audit under the same comparison conditions.
- A preliminary preview may remain available for inspection while this gate is
  open, but it must be described as preliminary and must not be presented as
  final visual approval.
- This gate supplements the rendered interaction and end-to-end evidence; a
  screenshot comparison cannot prove that enabled controls, persistence,
  recovery, or downstream integrations work.

### Tools and asynchronous work

- Partition tool calls into dependency layers. Execute safe independent
  calls in the same layer concurrently; serialize only real dependencies,
  semantic decisions, approvals, or conflicting mutations.
- Prefer asynchronous or nonblocking execution when supported and useful,
  especially for builds, tests, packaging, publication, and independent
  discovery. Start authorized dependency-ready work, then continue other
  useful work instead of waiting unnecessarily.
- Await a result when it is needed for the next dependent action, a
  consequential decision, or final verification—not merely because a
  background operation is running.
- Use bounded programmatic orchestration for mechanical pagination,
  filtering, joins, deduplication, and aggregation. Return compact
  structured conclusions, evidence, and errors.
- Delegate implementation only after shared schemas, directory layouts,
  ownership boundaries, and one cross-component acceptance fixture are
  fixed. Independently ready work has no unresolved shared-interface
  decision or overlapping mutable-file ownership.
- Choose delegation according to genuinely independent work, clear
  ownership, and integration needs rather than a fixed implementation-
  agent count. The parent remains the sole integration owner. Nested
  implementation delegation requires explicit parent authorization for
  that independent branch.
- Submit governed dependency-ready work to the configured host-wide
  scheduler. Do not invent local worker limits, fake dependencies, or
  a second capacity controller.
- Make cheap checks that can invalidate expensive downstream evidence real
  success dependencies. An ordinary failure does not cancel safe siblings.
  If the harness cannot express required concurrency, record the missing
  capability and use the best supported execution without false claims.
- Asynchronous execution is not fire-and-forget. Retain operation
  identities, observe completion and failures, preserve evidence, and
  perform required cleanup. Submission alone is never proof of success.
- Wait through blocking event subscriptions rather than model-turn status
  polling. Give each subscription an expected-event deadline, multiplex
  pending subscriptions, and return all due heartbeats through one shared
  scheduler.
- On wake, fetch bounded authoritative state once and advance its cursor.
  If events are unavailable, one service-owned watcher may poll using bounded
  backoff, resetting on a meaningful state change. The agent does not poll.
  Give the watcher a cancellation path and expected-event deadline; timeouts
  are failure ceilings. Choose backoff for the source and responsiveness need,
  not a blanket 100 ms interval. Deduplicate watchers for the same obligation.
- Before claiming completion, account for every required background
  operation and verify its result. Do not leave necessary work running
  unobserved or imply ongoing execution that has not been established.
