# Migration and Cutover Runbook (Phase 8)

Every step here that changes the live public edge, fences the legacy
system, removes direct Docker access, or imports live state is executed by
the owner, deliberately, with a rollback path. Concrete names (domain,
accounts, legacy unit names, paths) are instance data kept in the untracked
`instance/` directory; this runbook uses placeholders.

## Rust cutover preparation

- `devcoordinator2-tooling install configure` creates or preserves the client
  group, edge account, instance configuration, private source policies,
  direct skill/policy links, and the edge's read-only access to the canonical
  checkout. `--canary` keeps the edge HTTP-only on the selected private port.
- `devcoordinator2-tooling install build` accepts only a clean canonical
  `main` equal to the already-fetched `origin/main`. It builds all three Rust
  executables as the checkout owner, probes their embedded commit, hashes
  them, and writes a root-owned mode-0600 candidate manifest. There is no
  copied release tree.
- `devcoordinator2-tooling install verify` rechecks the candidate manifest,
  embedded commits, hashes, and executable identities. `install plan` shows
  the exact unit and direct-link targets without changing the live service.
- `devcoordinator2-tooling legacy export` produced a reviewable read-only export of the
  legacy stores (no secrets) at `instance/legacy-export.json`.
- `devcoordinator2-tooling legacy import --dry-run` prints what would be imported and a
  deployment declaration plan; without `--dry-run` it imports
  administrators, Telegram chat links/subscriptions, and open bugs.

## Pre-cutover proofs (handover §20)

1. **Public authentication/grant boundary** — register the console
   redirect URI with the identity provider for the canary origin, fill
   `/etc/devcoordinator2/edge/oidc.client_id|client_secret`, restart the
   edge, sign in as the bootstrap administrator, invite a second identity,
   confirm a granted route works and a revoked one is denied.
2. **One permanent heterogeneous deployment** (worker + PostgreSQL) — add
   `[deployment.*]` declarations (from the import plan) to one repository,
   `devcoordinator2 deployment apply <path> --name <name>@checkout`, verify
   via Console; repeat for a `@worktree` instance if wanted.
3. **Immediate test with Docker/PostgreSQL cleanup** — `[test.<name>.postgres]`
   in that repository; `devcoordinator2 test start`, verify the container is
   gone afterwards.
4. **Attribution and health reconciliation** — `devcoordinator2 health
   repositories` / Console Health: managed + DevCoordinator + other = host.
5. **Telegram and bugs** — put the bot token in the file named by
   `DEVCOORDINATOR2_TELEGRAM_TOKEN_FILE` (mode 0600), restart the daemon,
   `/start` the bot, `devcoordinator2 telegram link --code … --email …`,
   subscribe, trigger a deployment event; `devcoordinator2 bug report …`.

## Cutover

6. **Backup** legacy state (authority DB, edge publication, access control,
   Telegram state) to a dated directory outside both repositories.
7. **Fence legacy mutations**: stop the legacy API/broker/test units
   (names in `instance/legacy-notes.md`) but leave its edge running.
8. **Import reviewed state**: `devcoordinator2-tooling legacy import --export
   instance/legacy-export.json --state-dir /var/lib/devcoordinator2
   --bugs-dir /var/lib/devcoordinator2-bugs`; apply the reviewed deployment
   declarations so every public route of step 2 exists with its domain;
   re-decide the pending access request (invite or ignore).
9. **Activate once**: configure without `--canary` after installing the TLS
   credentials, build and verify the frozen candidate, then run
   `devcoordinator2-tooling install activate --yes`. The command closes test
   admission, fences the old socket, waits for accepted work, rejects an
   applying deployment, creates the private SQLite backup and installation
   snapshot, switches the units and direct binary links, and verifies the v2
   daemon and Node edge. If interrupted, run
   `devcoordinator2-tooling install recover --yes`; it restores the captured
   installation and restores the database when integrity fails or the failed
   candidate changed its schema beyond the captured prior installation.
   Same-schema startup failures preserve intact current data.
   Subsequent source updates are developed and validated in worktrees, merged
   to `origin/main`, then fetched and fast-forwarded into the clean
   `/home/DevCoordinator2` checkout. A later `install build`, `verify`, and
   reviewed `activate --yes` cycle repeats the same provenance and drain gates.
   The daemon and installer share the current database schema version, so an
   update remains installable after an earlier migration. Explicit legacy
   versions remain supported; unknown future versions are still refused.
10. **Docker authoritative mode** (owner decision DC2-…-DOCKER-MODE): remove
    agent accounts from the `docker` group, restart their sessions, verify
    `devcoordinator2 health containers` attributions; the observational
    label disappears from the security assumptions.
11. **Rollback**: prepare a revert in a worktree, merge it to `origin/main`,
    fast-forward the live checkout, and repeat the verified restart. Never
    rewrite or detach the live `main` checkout.

## Uninstalling the canary

`systemctl disable --now devcoordinator2 devcoordinator2-edge`, remove
`/etc/systemd/system/devcoordinator2*.service`, `/etc/tmpfiles.d/devcoordinator2.conf`,
`/usr/local/bin/devcoordinator2`, `/usr/local/bin/devcoordinator2-tooling`, any
inactive historical `/opt/devcoordinator2` source copies, and — only if the
state is not wanted — `/var/lib/devcoordinator2*`, `/etc/devcoordinator2`,
the `devcoordinator2-edge` user and `devcoordinator2-clients` group.
