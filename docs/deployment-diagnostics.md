# Deployment failure diagnostics

Trusted local agents covered by recorded standing owner authority may repair
Coordinator defects blocking approved development without another conversational
authorization. Follow `security-assumptions.md` and the repository's reviewed
non-self-hosting workflow. Mandatory host/tool controls still apply.

Deployment actions wait for their finite runtime operations rather than expiring
at the ten-second ordinary-read deadline. Closing a client does not cancel an
accepted deployment. Inspect `deployment status` before retrying; a retry is a new
attempt, not a way to recover the first client's response.

Compose build/start output is retained in the existing private build log, with
generation and component separators. Ordinary errors point to this surface rather
than embedding build output. Read only the needed bounded portion:

```sh
devcoordinator2 deployment logs --deployment-id <id> --component build --tail-lines 200
```

The log includes stdout and stderr even when the build fails, times out, or the
client disconnects. It is mode 0600 and uses the existing nofollow file boundary.
Rollback preserves the prior working generation but does not replace a new
component failure with its obsolete error. A missing component from the failed
candidate does not prevent reading the build log.

Earlier Compose output that was never retained cannot be reconstructed. After
diagnosis, an authorized retry captures fresh evidence; this does not by itself
prove the application's release scope complete.
