# Instance Configuration

All installation-specific values live outside the committed repository:

- Installed daemon: `/etc/devcoordinator2/instance.env`
  (root-owned, mode 0640, group = the daemon client group).
- Development: an untracked `.env` in the checkout root (gitignored), or
  `DEVCOORDINATOR2_*` environment variables directly.
- Human notes (accounts, legacy paths): the untracked `instance/`
  directory.

Environment variables override file values; file values override defaults.
Format: `KEY=value` lines, `#` comments, no quoting semantics beyond
stripping one pair of surrounding quotes.

## Variables (Phase 1)

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_SOCKET` | `/run/devcoordinator2/daemon.sock` | daemon Unix socket path |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_STATE_DIR` | `/var/lib/devcoordinator2` | authority DB and runtime state |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_UNIT_PREFIX` | `devcoordinator2-test` | transient test unit prefix (dev instances use e.g. `devcoordinator2-dev`) |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_SLICE` | `devcoordinator2-tests.slice` | parent slice for test units |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_CLIENT_GROUP` | `devcoordinator2-clients` | Unix group granted socket access |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_PORT_RANGE` | `20000-29999` | host port range the daemon leases to deployment components |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_BASE_DOMAIN` | (empty) | base public domain; deployment `domain` labels resolve beneath it (Phase 3+) |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_EDGE_UID` | (unset) | Unix uid of the edge service; the only peer allowed to assert a public identity |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_ADMIN_EMAILS` | (empty) | comma-separated bootstrap administrators |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_TELEGRAM_TOKEN_FILE` | (unset) | private 0600 file holding the single server-owned bot token; unset disables notifications |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_TELEGRAM_API` | `https://api.telegram.org` | API base (tests point it at a fixture) |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_BUGS_DIR` | `/var/lib/devcoordinator2-bugs` | independent open-bug store; world-writable so any local account reports bugs (DC2-2026-08-24-OPEN-LOCAL-ACCESS) |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_COMPOSE_ENV_ALLOWLIST_FILE` | (unset) | absolute private schema-1 JSON file authorizing exact repository-ID/relative-path Compose interpolation files |
| `DEVCOORDINATOR2_CODEX_USAGE_SOURCES_FILE` | (unset) | absolute root-only schema-1 JSON file listing the same-owner Codex collectors that may contribute combined repository analytics |

Edge configuration lives in `/etc/devcoordinator2/edge.env` (`docs/edge.md`).

The socket's runtime directory also contains three content-free coordination
files. `test-admission.lock` closes the start-versus-upgrade race;
`test-drain.json` is a root-owned live installer lease; and
`test-activity.json` is an atomic receipt containing only active run and unit
identities. A normal source-owned installer waits on receipt replacement
events before restarting services from the verified live checkout. A dead lease is removed on the next start,
and the first upgrade from an older daemon temporarily fences its socket with a
parent-death guard so an interrupted installer restores connectivity. None of
these files is completion evidence for a check, contains a command, output,
path, credential, or caller identity, or changes REQ-TEST-08 crash recovery.

## Compose environment-file authorization

Repository `env_file` declarations grant no authority by themselves. The
allowlist is `root:root` mode 0640, regular, non-symlink, at most 64 KiB, and
not group/world writable:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "authorizations": [
    {"repository_id": "r0123456789abcdef", "path": "deploy/dev.env"}
  ]
}
```

Each path is normalized, relative, and exact. Runtime use additionally proves
that the current file is regular, non-symlink, stays inside the worktree, and
remains Git-ignored. Missing or malformed policy refuses daemon startup;
missing authorization refuses the repository operation. Values are never read
into Coordinator metadata or results.

Only the root daemon loads and validates this policy. Thin CLI/MCP clients load
the socket and ordinary instance values, then submit requests to the daemon;
they need neither read nor write permission on the allowlist. Application
services and their APIs never receive the policy path or authorization data.

The installer accepts repeatable
`--compose-env-authorization REPOSITORY=RELATIVE_PATH`; it resolves the Git
common-root identity, proves the existing file is ignored and safe, merges the
private allowlist atomically, and adds the instance-file pointer without
removing prior authorizations.

### Scoped live changes

With the policy location already configured, trusted local callers and existing
server administrators can update one declared repository/file authorization
without restarting the daemon or reinstalling the instance:

```sh
devcoordinator2 config show
devcoordinator2 deployment preflight /path/to/repository --name web
devcoordinator2 config authorize /path/to/repository --name web --file deploy/dev.env --expected-revision REVISION
devcoordinator2 config revoke /path/to/repository --name web --file deploy/dev.env --expected-revision REVISION
devcoordinator2 config reload --expected-revision REVISION
```

Use the current `active_revision` from `config show`. Authorize/revoke preserve
every other entry and the file's owner and mode, atomically publish the private
policy, then activate it. Authorization still requires explicit approval of the
exact repository/file; preflight does not grant it. Revocation does not stop
already-running services, but subsequent Compose file use must pass the gate.

Reload validates the complete policy at its existing location. Invalid input
leaves the active configuration unchanged; external edits and concurrent stale
updates return `configuration_conflict` rather than silently overwriting changes.
Show returns counts, active/stored revision fingerprints, reload state, and the
latest 20 value-free change receipts; the complete receipt history stays in the
authority database. Neither values nor private policy paths are returned.

The policy location and all other instance settings still require the reviewed
installation/restart workflow. An unconfigured policy location returns
`configuration_restart_required`; live changes never create another policy
location, rewrite the instance file, or bypass a refused host approval.

The daemon holds an exclusive lifetime lease beside its Unix socket before
opening the database or recovering jobs. Duplicate startup preserves a live
listener. Missing owned sockets are recovered through directory events without
cancelling accepted operations; foreign replacement sockets/files are preserved.

## Codex usage sources

The source policy is a root-owned mode-0600 regular non-symlink file. Each
entry explicitly binds one non-root Unix UID to that account's private
`CODEX_HOME` and installed Codex executable:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "sources": [
    {
      "uid": 1000,
      "codex_home": "/home/developer/.codex",
      "executable": "/home/developer/.local/bin/codex"
    }
  ]
}
```

The daemon invokes the executable as that UID only to resolve the collector's
opaque repository key, then opens `usage/usage.sqlite3` read-only. Missing or
unsupported sources become partial coverage; they never block unrelated
Coordinator functions and never contribute zeroes. Paths, UIDs, account
aliases, and per-source values are not returned by the API.
Missing repository links are resolved only when an operator opens that
repository. Until then the collection says "Open repository to index usage";
successful links are persisted, so later collection reads and restarts stay
fast without launching unused Codex processes.

The installer accepts repeatable `--codex-usage-account UNIX_ACCOUNT` for the
default `~/.codex` and `~/.local/bin/codex` locations, merges the private policy
atomically, and preserves previously configured sources.

## Enforcement

`devcoordinator2-tooling check no-instance-data` scans committed content against the
untracked pattern list `instance/forbidden-strings.txt` and fails on any
match. Run it before every commit and in the acceptance checklist.
