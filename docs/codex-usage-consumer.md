# Codex usage consumer

DevCoordinator reads the producer's versioned `usage-v2` API. CodexMulti owns
the append-only journal, immutable segments, retention, publication and token
observations. Coordinator does not open, migrate or fall back to
`usage/usage.sqlite3`, and does not probe `codex usage`.

## Local contract

The private source policy selects a same-owner Unix socket. The consumer checks
its owner, the connected peer UID and the `codexHome` returned by `initialize`.
It requires the advertised usage-v2 capability and supported contract version
before calling `localUsage/summary`. A successful transport alone does not make
a collector available: the response must also have the negotiated version,
format, scope, exact UTC window and consistent snapshot metadata.

`localUsage/repositoryIdentity` resolves the producer's opaque repository key
for a registered local checkout. The path travels only as private IPC input;
it is not retained in normal usage records or returned in reports. Existing
repository mappings may be refreshed through this API. A retired source or an
unsupported capability remains a separately identified unavailable collector.

The summary keeps the existing `generatedAt`, `report` and `snapshot` envelope.
Its additive fields identify contract version 1 and source `usage-v2`. The
manifest format is 3; `databaseSchemaVersion` retains its historical JSON name
for compatibility. Snapshot generation, published watermark, represented
journal watermark, publication time, freshness and pending work describe the
same immutable view. The journal watermark may exceed the published watermark
when the reader includes a complete bounded tail.

Global, account, repository and thread queries use explicit producer filters.
A global total cannot establish a repository total. Repository totals cannot
establish task or workstream attribution. A continuation or comparison that
requires a specific snapshot supplies the producer's `expectedSnapshot` value;
an expired snapshot is an explicit failure rather than permission to combine
different generations. Detailed performance reads use finite windows and
bounded pages. Cached snapshots do not authorize a full-history foreground scan.

## Explicit work context

Coordinator retains a content-free declaration when an authorized governed
request supplies valid work context. The authority index is keyed by caller
source and operation ID and includes the Coordinator repository, native project,
thread, turn, workstream, outcome and experiment reference. It stores
declarations, not a duplicate usage event history. Conflicting declarations do
not overwrite the original context or silently acquire attribution.

The read-only producer request accepts a bounded `workContextBindings` array.
Each entry has `schemaVersion`, `operationId`, `capturedAtMs`, and `workContext`.
The context has `schemaVersion`, `id`, `repositoryId`, `nativeProjectId`,
`threadId`, `turnId`, `workstreamId`, `outcomeId`, and `experimentRef`. Optional
fields remain absent when undeclared. `repositoryId` inside the context names
the Coordinator repository; the summary's repository selector names the
producer repository. These are separate identity namespaces.

Only exact operation IDs with matching recorded repository/thread/turn evidence
can contribute attributed rows. Missing, conflicting or mismatched context
remains explicitly unattributed. A binding alone creates no operation, token
observation or delivery receipt. The optional producer-side binding file is
not required for Coordinator ingestion and is never written by the collector.

`includeReview` requests the finite review projection. Workstream selection
applies to outcome effort and rows; the repository summary retains its stated
scope. Unknown-context work remains visible. `review.prepare` preserves its
existing JSON fields, and review acceptance still requires interpreted evidence.
The integration does not change verdict rules to manufacture a completed review.

## Coverage, timing and privacy

Unavailable collectors are excluded, never counted as synthetic zeroes.
Provider total tokens are not reconstructed by adding components. Cached input
and reasoning output are subsets. Unknown measurements retain null exact values.
Summed concurrent operation durations are not elapsed wall time or active-agent
time; dimensions lacking the necessary intervals stay unknown.

Ordinary reports omit credentials, raw arguments, prompts, response bodies,
private paths and contributing account identities. Source references used by
the collector remain internal; human-facing source labels do not expose UIDs or
producer private identifiers. Existing operator/administrator access rules and
same-owner IPC authentication remain unchanged.

Reads retain response byte limits, bounded caches and deadlines. A transport
deadline bounds the consumer's wait; disconnecting does not necessarily stop a
producer worker already executing a bounded query. Failed capability checks,
expired snapshots, incomplete bindings and pending publication remain explicit
coverage states.

A cold exact-window read may take longer than the foreground review budget.
The collector coalesces it in the existing cache, returns explicit refreshing
coverage when the foreground wait expires, and retains the bounded background
result for the next identical request. A foreground timeout is not a thirty-second
source failure. Changing the window or work bindings selects a different cache
entry; a warm result is never borrowed from another scope.

The five-second freshness period starts revalidation; it does not make completed
measurements unavailable. A later request returns the last valid exact-query
snapshot while one bounded source refresh runs, including when the caller has
not yet consumed that completed snapshot. Coverage events identify
`api_snapshot_stale` and the pending or failed refresh reason. The display
snapshot's `updated_at_ms` is the producer's summary-generation time, so a new
request cannot make old measurements appear newly observed. The separate source
snapshot retains the producer's original publication times and frontiers.

A failed refresh preserves these measurements with
`refresh_failed: true` and the precise bounded reason until a successful refresh
replaces them. Cold failures still have no measurements. Existing memory, byte,
admission, retry and eviction bounds apply; no usage copy is stored durably.

## Verification and activation

Acceptance exercises authorized context ingestion and `review.prepare` through
the real collector transport. The producer fixture uses a v3 manifest, journal
and Parquet segments, including late facts and explicit bindings. Regressions
cover available fresh sources beside unsupported legacy sources, unchanged
review JSON, non-empty attributed rows, unattributed remainder, negotiation,
snapshot consistency and refusal to open retired SQLite.

Coordinator self-validation runs through its source executor's `run-local`
surface. Codex producer checks use their governed repository graph. Live
activation uses the reviewed root installer only after candidate acceptance;
source commits or parsed fixture responses alone are not live-deployment proof.
